# ROBI

---

This APP will be used locally in ROBI raspberry pi. To show the users emotions through a 7inch Touch Screen.
Also, this app allows the user to select (write, using a virtual keyword) a WiFi SID and PASSWORD. This info is transmitted
to another API running in ROBI (PYTHON based REST API) in order to change de file wpa_supplicant.conf to stablish a WiFi connection.

Happy coding :)
